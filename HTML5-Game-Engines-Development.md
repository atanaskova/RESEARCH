# HTML5 Game Engines & HTML5 Game Development

## HTML5 Game Development

To put it simple, HTML 5 Game Development is what we call game development that runs in a browser, that uses the exact same languages and tools of front-end development. By knowing HTML, CSS and JavaScript it is already possible to create simple games able to run on your every platform equipped with a browser. But that has been possible for a long time and, although some pretty addictive games can be created using that technology, to talk about HTML 5 game development is to talk about the canvas API.

If you want to build a game that works on a multitude of platforms, HTML5 is the way to go.

Distribution for HTML5 games is often thought of as a weakness, but that’s just because we’ve been looking at it in the same sense as native mobile games, where a marketplace is the only way to find games. With HTML5 games you have the incredible powerful hyperlink. 

Links can so easily be distributed across the web and mobile devices and it certainly should not just be limited to the main page for the game. The technology is there to be able to link to your game and do more interesting things like jump to a specific point in a game, try to beat a friend’s score, or play real-time against that friend.

One of the more obvious advantages of HTML5 for games is that the games will work on any modern device. Yes, you will have to put extra thought into how your game will respond to various screen sizes and input types, and yes, you might have to do a bit of ‘personalization’ in the code per platform (the main inhibitor being audio) but it’s far better than the alternative of completely porting the game each time.

Too many games don’t work on mobile and tablets, and in most instances that really is a huge mistake to make when developing your game – keep mobile in mind when developing your HTML5 game!

Making a game that runs in a browser means that the user doesn’t have to update it, since every time they run it they are automatically using the latest version.

And since browser nowadays get updated automatically, that means you can use everything your target browsers support without having to worry about leaving some users behind, since it simply what happen.

Also, since it runs in a browser, the users don’t need to install any extra library or tool. 

No waiting for compilation, updates and debugging in real-time, and once the game is done, you can push out the update immediately.

It is largely a personal decision whether you need a Game Engine or not. Game Engines will almost always reduce the time it takes for you to create a fully-functional game, but some just like the process of building everything from the ground up so they can better understand every component of the game.

## HTML5 Game Engines

So here is a collection of HTML5 game engines,libraries and frameworks to create 2D and 3D WebGl or Canvas based games or even VR. Part of them are complete game platforms with physics engine, collision detection, animation, 3d environment, etc:
