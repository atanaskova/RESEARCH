# Mobile-First Design

## *What is mobile-first design?*

Mobile-first design is a design philosophy that aims to create better experiences for users by starting the design process from the smallest of screens: mobile. 

Designing and prototyping your websites for mobile devices first helps you ensure that your users experience is seamless on any device.

### *Why is mobile-first design important?*

It’s a matter of numbers: There are projected to be more than 3.5 billion mobile users in 2020, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/). That means the majority of people are using their **phones** to find the content they need. There’s a big need for mobile-friendly websites out there, and so it’s your job to supply it for your users.

To understand the concept of mobile-first design better, you should know the two phrases below first:

- **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**
- **“Progressive Advancement” & “Graceful Degradation”**

## 1. Responsive Web Design (RWD)

Responsive web design is a web design method that enables web to fit the screens of different devices automatically, displaying the content in a way that people feel comfortable. This greatly reduces users’ operations like panning, zooming and scrolling when browsing the web.

## 2. "Progressive Advancement" & "Graceful Degradation"
These two concepts were put forward before responsive web design. In order to make web or application interface display reasonably on different devices, designers provide customized versions of product for different ends.

"Progressive Advancement" means that when we design a product, first we build a version for the relatively lower browser (like that on a mobile phone). This version includes the most basic functions & features. After that, we tend to the advanced version for a tablet or PC, which is created by adding interactions, more complicated effects, etc. on the basic version for a better user experience.

"Graceful Degradation" on the contrary, starts the product design from an advanced end like desktop and builds a version with well-rounded features at the beginning. Then designers make the product compatible with mobile ends by cutting some functions or contents.

But if we take the mobile end product design as a starting point, under the restrictions like bandwidth, screen size and so on, designers will naturally seize the key points of a product, head for a lean & neat product with prioritized features. When the platform is expanded to a tablet or PC, designers are able to take advantages of the unique features of these advanced ends to strengthen the product step by step. This might be the main reason that progressive advancement strategy is widely used.

>**“Mobile first”, as the name suggests, means that we start the product design from the mobile end which has more restrictions, then expand its features to create a tablet or desktop version.**

## *Pros & Cons*

### **1. Pros**

- **It gets people the information they need,** regardless of where they’re accessing your website from. When people look something up on their mobile device, they want quality content that answers their questions or helps them make a decision. A mobile-first approach, which showcases the most important content, would help you meet that need.

- **Fewer bugs.** The reason for this is simple – less code means fewer opportunities for bugs. As mentioned, desktop-first involves starting with something complex that is then adapted to smaller screens. This code-heavy starting point entails a greater risk of bugs later on. With a simpler mobile-first approach, you will be able to detect and prevent bugs more easily.

- **Better ranking on Google.** In July 2018, Google made page speed a ranking factor for mobile searches. This “Speed Update” has caused companies across the globe to improve their page speeds, with some performance metrics hitting 20%. What we can take away from this is that speed is a priority. Chances are your competitors are actively trying to improve this. A mobile-first website will have faster load times as compared to a desktop-first one being viewed on mobile, where even hidden elements need to be loaded.

### **2.Cons**

- **Smaller canvas,** less room for creativity, at least for most web designers right now. They’re used to a more accommodating desktop-sized space. Asking them to work on a smaller canvas with fewer tools could make them feel restricted. Depending on the designer, this could be either a welcome or unwelcome challenge.

- **Uncertainty for clients.** Since they will not be able to view the desktop version until much later, your clients may not be comfortable with a mobile-first approach. Unless they have complete faith in your judgment, they may not be willing to move away from a desktop-first approach.

- **Training time and costs.** To develop and execute a mobile-first design strategy, you will need a team that understands the new design methods it will involve. You may have to train your team or hire more resources to help take on this challenge.
