# UI libraries for React

## **What is React?**

React is an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build a top interface for both the web as well as mobile apps. It combines conveniently with other JavaScript frameworks and libraries, and contains tiny, standalone bits of code called components.

The nice thing about components is that they’re modular without much app-specific dependencies. This means that you get to reuse the components to build awesome apps and interfaces super fast.

## 1. *Material UI*

Material UI is based on Google’s Material Design. It provides easier and faster React components built with Material Design.

## 2. *React Bootstrap*

Bootstrap is the most popular grid-based CSS framework. React Bootstrap is an open-source library created for developers to easily use Bootstrap in React applications.

In order to give you more control over the form and function of each component, it replaces Bootstrap’s JavaScript with React. Each component is built to be easily accessible, important for front-end framework building.

And since React Bootstrap doesn’t deviate much from its Bootstrap origins, developers can choose from the thousands of Bootstrap themes readily available.

## 3. *Onsen UI*

If you're creating a cross-platform application, you'll be interested in this.

Material and Flat design come into one place in Onsen UI. The thing I like about this library is it makes your web app look like a native one. So, if you’re going for mobile-first, pick this one.

Onsen UI is a mobile app development framework that uses HTML5 and JavaScript and provides integration with Angular, Vue.js and React. All the components are auto-styled based on the platform, and so it supports both iOS and Android using the same source code.

## 4. *Blueprint*

In Blueprint, components are made of TypeScript and styled with Sass to accelerate the development. This library focuses on data presentation on desktop applications running on modern browsers.

Blueprint is a React-based UI toolkit for the web.

It is optimized for building complex, data-dense web interfaces for desktop applications which run in modern browsers and IE11 and it is not a mobile-first UI toolkit.

From the component library, you can pick up bits of code for generating and displaying icons, for interacting with dates and times, for picking timezones, breadcrumbs, buttons, callouts, cards, divider, navbars, tabs, tags and much more.

>On GitHub, it clocks in at 15,000+ stars.

Ant Design is a design system for enterprise-level products written in Typescript with predictable static types. It consists of a set of high-quality React components with powerful theme customization.

You also have the ability to customize the components to your own design specifications. Ant Design uses Less.js for its style language. The Ant Design components include buttons, icons, grids, breadcrumb, dropdown menus, pagination, and more.
