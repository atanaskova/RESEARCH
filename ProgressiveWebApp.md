# Progressive Web Application

A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.

While web applications have been available for mobile devices from the start, they have generally been slower, have had fewer features, and have been less used than native apps. PWA features allow to close the gap to native applications and create similar user experiences.

Features include:

- Work offline
- High performance
- Background processing in service workers in a separate thread
- Access to the phone's sensors
- Support for push notifications
- An icon on the phone‘s home screen

Since a progressive web app is a type of webpage or website known as a web application, they do not require separate bundling or distribution. 

In particular, there is no requirement for developers or users to install the web apps via digital distribution systems like [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store). 

However, for many PWA providers the lack of visibility of the PWA in those distribution systems is a disadvantage compared to native apps. To varying degrees, the major app stores started to embrace PWAs, allowing them to be found in app stores.

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver enhanced capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching *anyone*, *anywhere*, on *any device* with a single codebase.

## The three app pillars

Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed so they are **capable**, **reliable**, and **installable**.

These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application.

## 1. Capable

The web is quite capable in its own right today. For example, you can build a hyper-local video chat app using WebRTC, geolocation, and push notifications. You can make that app installable and take those conversations virtual with WebGL and WebVR. With the introduction of Web Assembly, developers can tap into other ecosystems, like C, C++, and Rust, and bring decades of work and capabilities to the web too.

Until recently, only platform-specific apps could really lay claim to these capabilities. While some capabilities are still out of the web's reach, new and upcoming APIs are looking to change that, expanding what the web can do with features like file system access, media controls, app badging, and full clipboard support. All of these capabilities are built with the web's secure, user-centric permission model, ensuring that going to a website is never a scary proposition for users.

Between modern APIs, Web Assembly, and new and upcoming APIs, web applications are more capable than ever, and those capabilities are only growing.

## 2. Reliable

A reliable Progressive Web App feels fast and dependable regardless of the network.

Speed is critical for getting users to use your experience. In fact, as page load times go from 1 second to ten seconds, the probability of a user bouncing increases by 123%. Performance doesn't stop after the onload event. Users should never wonder whether their interaction — for example, clicking a button — was registered or not. Scrolling and animation should feel smooth. Performance affects your entire experience, from how users perceive your application to how it actually performs.

Finally, reliable applications need to be usable regardless of network connection. Users expect apps to start up on slow or flaky network connections or even when offline. They expect the most recent content they've interacted with, like media tracks or tickets and itineraries, to be available and usable even if getting a request to your server is hard. When a request isn't possible, they expect to be told there's trouble instead of silently failing or crashing.

Users love apps that respond to interaction in the blink of an eye, and an experience they can depend on.

## 3. Installable

Installed Progressive Web Apps run in a standalone window instead of a browser tab. They're launchable from on the user's home screen, dock, taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the device they're installed on.

New capabilities open up after a web app is installed. Keyboard shortcuts usually reserved when running in the browser, become available. Progressive Web Apps can register to accept content from other applications, or to be the default application to handle different types of files.

When a Progressive Web App moves out of a tab and into a standalone app window, it transforms how users think about it and interact with it.
