# Naming Coventions (HTML & CSS)

In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:

- To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code.

- To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.

- To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.

Using a naming convention, it’s easy to see the link between the HTML and CSS by looking at either of the code bases.

A well thought out naming convention also reduces the chances of collisions.

By reducing the page to a set of components, one only needs to consider the names of other components to avoid collisions. Within a component, one only needs to consider other elements also within the component.

Collision detection is reduced from considering the entire web site, to considering only a sub-section of the site. In the final stretch of a development project, this keeps the focus on the end goal, rather than having to take time out to work out why one selector is stepping on the toes of another.

Having a naming convention in and of itself doesn’t solve any problems, but using a systematic approach does. The naming convention makes it easier to stick to a system.

## The following are some naming conventions that you can employ:
- [BEM](bem.md)
- SMACSS (Style-guide to write your CSS with five categories for CSS rules)
- ITCSS (Structured class names and meaningful hyphens)
- OOCSS (Separating container and content with CSS “objects”)

No matter what methodology you choose to use in your projects, you will benefit from the advantages of more structured CSS and UI. Some styles are less strict and more flexible, while others are easier to understand and adapt in a team.
